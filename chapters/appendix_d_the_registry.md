# Appendix D — The Registry: Every GO-P-2026 ID and Its Disposition

*The "no file drawer" claim rides on the registration sequence having no unexplained
holes. This appendix gives every assigned `GO-P-2026-NNN` ID a disposition, so any reader
can verify the sequence is gap-free and every sealed run is reported at equal prominence
— confirmations and misses alike. Authoritative outcomes are in `claims/LEDGER.md`; this
table is the index that proves completeness. It mirrors `claims/REGISTRY-ACCOUNTING.md`.*

**Disposition classes.** `core` = falsifiable-core row GO-1…GO-6 (Papers I/I.5/II);
`cost` = a COST-face theorem harness (Paper III); `sweep` = a domain-generality row
(Paper IV, VALUE face); `superseded→NNN` = a registered miss/flawed design corrected by a
successor (the miss is still reported); `never-run` = an ID never assigned to a file or a
run; `void` = a reservation abandoned unsealed.

## Completeness argument

The assigned sequence is **001–041 with two skips (029, 030) and one void (040)**, and
every other ID resolves to a registered run reported in the ledger.

- **022–028** are the COST-face theorem harnesses (Paper III), a different shadow of the
  same object; their absence from the VALUE sweep is a scope boundary, not suppression.
  Four carry logged verification incidents (VI-4…VI-7), all caught pre-publication.
- **029, 030** were never assigned — no prereg, no run, no result JSON at any commit
  (verified: no filename containing `029`/`030` in `git log --all --name-only` over
  `prereg/`). A documented numbering skip.
- **040** was an unsealed reservation for the κ *magnitude* law, which failed validation
  and was abandoned (Paper IV Remark; the κ *ordering* law stands, Chapter 12). A void, not
  a removed result.

**Supersession chains** (each miss reported, then corrected): 001→002 · 007→008→009 ·
012→013→014 · 016→017→018→019 · 020→021 · 032→033 · 035→036 (→039).

**No file-drawer holds:** every sealed run appears in the ledger regardless of sign; the
only gaps carried no run.

## Commit-ordering audit (seal predates run)

For every sealed confirmation the registration commit is a genuine **ancestor** in the git
DAG of the commit that first added its result — not merely an earlier calendar date.
Checked with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <seal> <result-add>`; all pass (A2-021,
A1-031, A3-033, D2/D3-034, L-036, W-038). Every result commit is strictly downstream of
its seal; the ordering is verifiable at any snapshot, including the DOI'd release. (Full
commit hashes in `claims/REGISTRY-ACCOUNTING.md`.)

## Statistical audit (headline rows)

Every reported percentage carries its $n$, its sealed bar, and its null. Flip/recon-trade
nulls are a per-query coin flip ($p = 0.5$); the anti null is worst-of-three ($p = 1/3$).

| Row | Arm | Count | Bar | `P(≥k | null)` | Read |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D2 AV16.3 | flip | 148/201 | ≥60% | 7.0e-12 | decisive |
| D3 PDAR | flip | 13/17 | ≥55% | 2.5e-2 | modest alone → carried by recon-trade 17/17 (7.6e-6) |
| A3 LOCATA | flip | 11/13 | ≥8/13 | 1.1e-2 | supported |
| W 038 | flip | 300/300 | ≥60% | 2⁻³⁰⁰ | decisive |
| L 039 | flip | 200/200 boot | ≥60% | 2⁻²⁰⁰ | virgin split, margin 2× of 036 |
| **D1 radar** | anti | 15/25 | ≥70% | 5.6e-3 | above chance, below bar → registered MISS (partial) |
| **D4 optim** | flip | 82/300 | >50% | ≈1.0 | at/below chance → honest NULL (correct) |

The two non-confirmations are kept explicit: D1's anti control is above its worst-of-three
chance but below the sealed bar (the tiny array's ~15° resolution) → **partial**; D4's flip
sits at the coin-flip null while its anti arm is 300/300 → the read operator governs the
task but the flip is genuinely absent (curvature ≡ signal-energy coupling) → **honest
null**. Legal-036's thin margin (Δ=0.008) is the one row that needed a caveat, and it was
resolved by the virgin-split rerun 039 (Δ=0.016, double), removing the held-out-reuse
asterisk.
